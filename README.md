### Blogger application, demonstrating use of Angular4 and Laravel5+.

### Description
Two projects are there which are made using Angular4 and Laravel5 frameworks. Through this I am just demonstrating the use of both both laravel and angular in single project. It was really fun to learn all these stuff.

### Working
Run the backend server that is Laravel after [installing](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/installation), by running the following command in blogger_laravel directory
```
php artisan serve
```

Run the frontend server that is Angualr4 after [installing](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart#devenv), by running the following command in blogger_angular directory
```
ng serve
```

Now hit on localhost:4200 where anuglar server is listening the request. It will serve the connectivity with backend which is running on localhost:8000. You might be be having the project running.
